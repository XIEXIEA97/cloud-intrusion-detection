# cloud-intrusion-detection

Directly takes computer memory raw data as input and determines whether the target operating system is invaded an under what kind of intrusion.
Attempt to use three approaches for processing memory to extract features and design machine learning classifiers accordingly. 
The models are trained, tested and compared with a self made small dataset.
